1. Create folder projects and cd there. 
2. Download prebuilded sqlite3 release version. Unpack it into projects 
3. Run clone with --recursive flag in projects/ directory git clone --recursive git://github.com/tarasko/sociorm.git 
4. Create new folder in projects. Call it sociorm.msvc and cd there. 
5. Run cmake ..\sociorm 
6. Open generated solution and start to do something on project sociorm.
